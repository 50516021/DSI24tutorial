# Spatial Attention - DSI24 tutorial
Tutorial and utilities for Spatial Attention by using Wearable Sensing DSI-24

This repository contains example scripts and utilities for running a
spatial attention (Spatial Attention) experiment with the Wearable Sensing
DSI-24 EEG system, and for organizing and processing the recorded data.

The project is organized into two main parts:

- `SpatialAttention_exp/` – MATLAB scripts and resources for running the
  spatial attention experiment.
- `SpatialAttention_anl/` – example data folders and a workspace for
  analysis scripts on DSI-24 recordings.
